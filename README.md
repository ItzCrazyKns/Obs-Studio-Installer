## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the OBS

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OPKns/Obs-Studio-Installer/main/installer.sh)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._
